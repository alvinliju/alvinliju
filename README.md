# Hey, I'm Alvin 👨‍💻

**Web Developer | Part-Time Bug Hunter | Full-Time Coffee Drinker**

I build stuff on the web and occasionally break things (for fun and profit). Atlest didnt write my readme with AI lol...

## 🛠️ Toolbox
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (because SQL is too mainstream)
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code, and a lot of caffeine

## 🌱 Currently
- Learning how to make TypeScript stop yelling at me
- Trying to center a div without Googling (it’s harder than it sounds)
